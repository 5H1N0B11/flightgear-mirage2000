backseat on multiplayer, the copilot is named NOSA (Navigateur Officier Système d'Arme)

how to test multiplayer on same PC ?
- run flightgear with parameters :       --aircraft=m2000-5B          --multiplay=out,10,127.0.0.1,5000 --multiplay=in,10,127.0.0.1,5001 --callsign="PILOT" --prop:/sim/remote/pilot-callsign="NOSA"

2017-01
================================================================================

new biplace version
-------------------
The aircraft model is common between mono and bi, some parts are shown or not
for example :
- mirage 2000-5 : m2000-5-set.xml includes Systems/m2000-5-base.xml which loads Models/m2000-5.xml which hide biplace parts
- mirage 2000-5B (launch with --aircraft=m2000-5B) : m2000-5B-set.xml (new file) includes Systems/m2000-5B-base.xml (new file) which loads Models/m2000-5B.xml (new file) which hide monoplace p

- adapted logo uvmap, antennas placement
- modelized back seat panel
- added copilot's left and right panel
- placed copilot's instruments and canopy handles
- placed copilot model in the back seat
- created a new view (no=11, id=103) from the back seat
- new livery mirage 2000D

other improvments
-----------------
- models : added some ground equipment (scale, flags, intakes obturators)
- 3d : corrected the front gear doors (4 doors and not 2)
- texture : improved wheels
- uvmap : corrected rotation center of the turbine
- 3d : shade of intakes
- 3d+texture : improve pole of in-flight refueling
- texture : regeneration of some liveries


2016
================================================================================
OPRF ready
new textures (swamp)
new instruments
SAS improvments


2015-02
================================================================================
3D :
- Several more instrument in the cockpit. The working ones are : startup instrument, light variator instruments.
  (The others, I'm still working on it)
- New gun explosion : more realistics
- New missiles explosion : more realistics
- New flames that take differents colors, depending of the sun position
- New light effect in the cockpit when using Rembrandt.
- New rule about each instruments lights effects
- Possibility to disable the pilot.
- Desactivate temporary the "non Rembrandt Shadow" that have big issue in MP (and do not allow a correct dogfight)
- New "Exhaust"
- Sperated livery & logos (that allow differents HQ logos independently of the livery)

Systems :
- Double center Mfd for the guys who want (or not) the canvas one. The older is now working lot more better.
- Working startup procedure
- Working cockpit light variator
- Working Tutorial.(Even if  there no maker use yet)
Weapons
- Ground designation : This now possible to create a "ground target", by clicking on the ground and then clicking
  at the "Create a Target" in "Mirage 2000 > Fast Config" menu.

Nasal :
- Lot of improvement by using a centralised function lanch and update instead of setListener or multiple different
  loop. This should invisble to the user except that their FPS will stay high
- Allow loads under the wings (missiles, tanks etc) to be visible over MP, even, if you are not in a m2000, and even
  if you have more than 1 aircraft forlder


2014-10
================================================================================

3D : Correction du model : Servos commande, Souris, Manette de gaz, boutons de démarrage
- Changement des UV map, animation des slats, ajout de tip trail, position du parachute

Xml
- Ajout du canvaset de ses boutons et du double mfd pour ceux qui n'aiment pas le canvas
- Ajout des tooltips

Yasim
- Correction + mise à jour version + Activation parachute, recul lor du tir.

Nasal
- Correction des bugs de lenteurs, creations des systèmes electriques, fuel, huiles
- Procédure de démarrage et nouvelle gestion du moteur, début de commande de vol electrique
  (pour ça que ça ne dérappe plus en fin de piste),
- Ajout de la navigation TACAN et suivi de route (renseigné par le gestionnaire de route MAJ du code de FSIG)
- Ajout d'un fonction brake (que l'on peut implementer dans le joystick) et qui anime les aerofreins en vol
  (ça veut dire que l'on peut refuel sans quitter le manche)
- Guns : correction du tir (impossible au sol) + cadence de tir etc...
  Et surement d'autres trucs

2013-02
================================================================================

- Correction of tiger2 livery call.
- Correction of problems on nav intrument (in "no nav-id" zones)

2013-01
================================================================================

- ENGINE :
------------
- Correction the Nasal
- Exhaust/thurst update (double nozzle)
- Improved "Mouse" -> Inlet cones for supersonic flight  ... ( they go out > Mach 1.25 ).
- Reheat Correction (Using n value, instead of throttle value)

- Electric flight control :
---------------------------
- Slats : they have an automated movement, during flight, and are retracted when landing (but still can be reopened
  manualy in case of engine failure)
- SAS System Stabilizer Automatic Flight Stabilizer flight depending on the position of the joystick ( Still job to
  do to improve that )
Note : this make stick less sensitive for low stick value or high speed. Also work for the nosewheel : > 10kts it become more stable with speed increasing

- Nasal :
---------
- Centralization of "init" functions of the various systems , (to "revive" systems in case of faillure (real or simulated
  crash) and help "restart" management (in the future)) -> This still need to be improved
- More reviews in the party " missile.nas " ( <- Not Enough)
- Correction of some bugs in nav & radar

- Graphical stuff :
-------------------
- High resolution texture (2048 * 2048) I made only 2 , but it's really pretty.
- Adding pilot view

- Instrument/Alert :
--------------------
- Jettinson : Yellow and black button to drop the tanks in case of emergency ( I rebossé texture button) and ajjout a keyboard
  shortcut (Shift + J). This helps unlock the full keypad, and so those who use it for steering can be used without problems.
- HUD : Change the target display in the HUD : This overlaped and did not read all the infos. Everything is readable now.
- Stall Warning Alert + stall (On the HUD and on the alert panel)
- Transponder : Working transponder. Actually only the civilian part of the Transpondeur is working

- Loads :
---------
- Quick loads are closer in name and in load to what we can see on a real mirage 2000

-Other Stuff :
--------------
- Normalisation in order to make this aircraft available to "Aircraft_Selection_Criteria" (but not finished yet)
