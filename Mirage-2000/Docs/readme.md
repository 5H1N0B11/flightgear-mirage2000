# Content of the Docs Folder #

The content of the `Docs` folder has evolved historically.

## Manuals: ##
* mirage2000-old-manual.pdf: A quite comprehensive manual in one Document. Is out-of-date in some areas (e.g. VTM, radar and weapons) but still useful.
* mirage2000-new-manual.pdf: The new manual which over time will replace the old manual. But for now the content is concentrated around weapons management, radar etc. (which are the focus of current development).

## Supporting files for pilots: ##
* wingman_m2000-5_demo.xml and wingman_m2000-5D_demo: AI scenarios to have a second Mirage as a wingman.

## Files for developers: ##
* manual_rst directory: Contains the source files for the new manual.
