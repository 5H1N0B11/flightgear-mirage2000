# Content of the Docs Folder # 

The content of the `Docs` folder has evolved historically. 

## Manuals: ##
* Mirage 2000 manual.pdf: A quite comprehensive manual in one Document. Is out-of-date in some areas (e.g. VTM, radar and weapons) but still useful.
* mirage2000-new-manual.pdf: The new manual which over time will replace the old manual. But for now the content is concentrated around weapons management, radar etc. (which are the focus of current development).

## Supporting files for pilots: ##
* fgfs-screen-00x.png: screenshots with some annotations.
* wingman_m2000-5_demo.xml and wingman_m2000-5D_demo: AI scenarios to have a second Mirage as a wingman.
* m2000-MFD-PA.*: documentation of the left MFD and the autopilotâ€”in French.

## Files for developers: ##
* mfd_display_left.odg: helps developers with understanding the naming in MFDs.
* manual_rst: Contains the source files for the new manual.
