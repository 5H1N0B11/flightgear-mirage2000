FlightGear Mirage 2000 Documentation
====================================

Welcome to the documentation of the `Dassault Mirage 2000 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault_Mirage_2000>`_ for the `FlightGear <https://www.flightgear.org/>`_ open source flight simulator.

The Mirage 2000 modelled here is mainly the -5 version ("Dash 5"/"tiret cinque"). The bi-place versions 2000D/N and 2000-B are also modelled to some degree (weapons, exterior 3d), but the cockpit remains the -5 version.

The Mirage 2000 is a multi-role all-weather fighter aircraft from `Dassault Aviation <https://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/defense/customer-support/operational-aircraft/mirage-2000/>`_. It is one of the best `dogfighters <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogfight>`_ and a far beyond visual range combat aircraft, as well as very capable in air-to-ground strikes.

This Documentation
------------------

The goal of this wiki is to be the most up to date source of information for pilots of this simulation model - in line with recent development of features. As such it documents how the FlightGear Mirage 2000 works - not necessarily how it works in reality!

This manual has been written in order to help you get to know the Mirage 2000 and master flying and fighting with it. The French Delta Knife is not always easy to handle, but we hope the pages in this wiki will allow you to become better at fighting with the M2000.

If you find rooms for improvement in this manual, then please either ping one of the authors on `Discord <https://discord.gg/ApmtWcUh>`_ or create an Issue in the GitHub repo.

Other Documentation
-------------------

Apart from this wiki documentation, there are other sources of documentation for the FlightGear version:

* The `wiki page <https://wiki.flightgear.org/Dassault_Mirage_2000-5>`_ on the official `FlightGear wiki <https://wiki.flightgear.org/>`_ (not very well maintained).
* When you download the aircraft, then in the "Docs" folder there is an extensive manual in `PDF format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF>`_ (being the original source ("copy") of this wiki, which will eventually replace the document).
* The main and original author of the FlightGear version has some `5H1N0B1 YouTube videos <https://www.youtube.com/@5H1N0B1/videos>`_ (a bit aged).
* The excellently modelled FlightGear version of the `F-16 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon>`_ has a very well written `wiki <https://github.com/NikolaiVChr/f16/wiki>`_, which also explains concepts (e.g. how a radar works).

`RAZBAM <https://www.razbamsimulationsllc.com/>`_ has made a remarkable simulation of the Mirage 2000C variant for `DCS <https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/index.php>`_. There is quite some documentation for it and an active forum, but it is an earlier variant for the Mirage 2000 and therefore has somewhat other capabilities and a distinctively different cockpit.

* Renaud "Wolf" Roquefort has written the first extensive documentation. This wiki is an enhanced copy of it - and would have felt too overwhelming if there would not have been such a great source. The acknowledgements in Wolf's original work are as follows: "I would like to thank everyone who helped me on this project. My first words of thanks go to S. "VooDoo3" Liakos, who gave me the idea of the manual in the first place, and for being a supportive friend. I am not certain this manual would exist without him. I thank I. "Interce" Klimov, 5H1N0B1 and CUDA22 as well for their support during the creation of this manual. Thank you to all who did changes and improvements to this manual, or pointed out things to modify: Legoboyvdlp, Rudolf, CUDA22, Reaper, and 5H1N0B1 himself."

"Wolf" Roquefort, Rick Gruber-Riemer

* The authors of the common weapons and radar systems for `OpRedFlag <https://github.com/NikolaiVChr/OpRedFlag>`_, on which this model depends and which makes it possible, to use the plane in air and ground attack as part of military simulation in the `OPRF <https://opredflag.com/>`_ (Open Red Flag) community.

* The authors of the `FlighGear F-16 <https://github.com/NikolaiVChr/f16>`_ are a constant source of inspiration - and the level of sophistication of the model is what the M2000 is aiming for, but maybe never will get on par with.
