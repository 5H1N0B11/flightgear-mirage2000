IFF
***

An `Identification Friend or Foe⇗ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_friend_or_foe>`_ system is for combat scenarios. Despite the name, IFF can only positively identify friendly aircraft, it cannot identify foes. An enemy aircraft is undistinguishable from e.g. a civilian aircraft, or an aircraft with a non-functioning IFF system.

IFF interrogations from elsewhere towards your aircraft is supported (i.e. others can tell whether you are a friend of foe). See :ref:`link_section_transponder` for a description of the cockpit instruments.

IFF interrogations from your aircraft towards other aircraft is not yet modelled (i.e. you cannot tell friends from foes).

The Mirage 2000 supports 2 IFF channels. According to [ref: D04] the IFF code gets automatically switched at midnight from A to B. This is not modelled.

The IFF channel codes are set in menu item ``Mission Preplanning`` accessed through menu ``Mirage 2000`` (if damage is on, then it can only be done on ground!).
