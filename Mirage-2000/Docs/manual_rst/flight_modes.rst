Flight Modes
============

There are 4 flight modes:

* Take-off (`key: f`)
* Approach (`key: F`)
* Navigation (`key: h`)
* Attack (`key: H`)

The main difference between the flight modes for now is the view position and zoom. When you lower gear, then you get automatically into `Approach` mode - after gear up you end in mode `Navigation`. Toggling the master arm switches to mode `Attack` or `Navigation`.

In Cockpit Views
================

In order to see the MFDs and the VTB better as well as seeing better the gauges on each side of the VTM, you can use key bindings:

* `Key: n`: view left MFD and VTB
* `Key: N`: view right MDF and VTB
* `Key: ctrl-n`: reset the view to the position of the current flight mode
