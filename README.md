The Mirage 2000 modelled here is mainly the -5 version ("Dash 5"/"tiret cinque"). The bi-place versions 2000D/N are also modelled to some degree (weapons, exterior 3d), but the cockpit remains for the moment the -5 version. There is also a -5B and -5B backseater version, but it is deprecated, not actively tested and might therefore simply not work.

Two PDF manuals are located in the Mirage-2000/Docs/ folder—e.g. accessible within FlightGear through the menu `Mirage 2000 > New | Old PDF Manual`:
* [The new manual](https://github.com/5H1N0B11/flightgear-mirage2000/blob/master/Mirage-2000/Docs/mirage2000-new-manual.pdf)
* [The old manual](https://github.com/5H1N0B11/flightgear-mirage2000/blob/master/Mirage-2000/Docs/mirage2000-old-manual.pdf)
